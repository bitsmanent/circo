Hello
=====
circo is a small IRC client for the terminal. It provides a list of views to
differentiate between channels, users, and other messages. Each buffer has its
own input text while other relevant informations such as server and nickname
are always visible the top.

Input editing is yet incomplete and parsing of server messages need some
cleanup. The code is working, I'm using it for a while and didn't notice any
issue.

Despite it's minimal design, circo is definitely not a suckless piece of code.
It don't even follows in all respect the UNIX philosophy but it provides a very
power bridge to the IRC servers with a such small code base. In this regard
circo is unique. I'm also having a lot of fun in writing circo.

If you also wanna have fun, please consider submitting a pull request.
