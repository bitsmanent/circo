.SH DESCRIPTION
.B circo
is a small IRC client for the terminal. It provides a list of views (buffers)
to differentiate between channels, users, and other messages. Each buffer has
its own input text while other relevant informations such as server and
nickname are always visible at the top.

None of the CTCP specification has been (nor will be) implemented, which means
no DCC at all. In other words: direct chat and files sending are not available.
